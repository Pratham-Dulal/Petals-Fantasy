Code Structure & Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Single Responsibility Principle → one file/module = one purpose

Clear folder structure (by feature, not random files)

Separation of concerns

UI / Logic / Data / API must be separate

Avoid God files (no 1000+ line files)

Bad:
app.js does everything
Good:
auth/, users/, payments/, utils/

2. Naming Rules (Clarity > Cleverness)

Variables, functions, files must explain themselves

No short names unless obvious (i, id)

Same meaning → same name everywhere

Bad:

let x = getData()


Good:

let userProfile = fetchUserProfile()

3. Consistent Code Style

Use one formatter (Prettier / Black)

Use linting (ESLint)

Same:

indentation

quotes

spacing

No personal style wars

📌 Consistency matters more than preference.

4. Git Rules (Very Important)

Small, meaningful commits

One commit = one logical change

Commit messages:

feat: add savings goal logic
fix: prevent negative balance
refactor: simplify auth middleware


Never push:

secrets

.env

API keys

5. Comments (Explain WHY, not WHAT)

Code should explain what

Comments explain why

Bad:

// add 1 to i
i++


Good:

// retry once because payment API sometimes times out

6. Error Handling (No Silent Failures)

Always handle:

API errors

DB failures

null / undefined

Never swallow errors

Bad:

try { doSomething() } catch {}


Good:

catch (err) {
  logError(err)
  throw err
}

7. Configuration Management

No hard-coded values

Use:

env variables

config files

Separate:

dev

staging

production

8. DRY — But Don’t Over-Abstract

Avoid copy-paste logic

BUT don’t create abstractions too early

Rule:

Copy once → fine
Copy twice → consider refactor
Copy thrice → MUST refactor

9. Testing Discipline

Write tests for:

critical logic

money flows (important for you 👀 Khutruke)

At least:

unit tests

basic integration tests

No test = risky change later.

10. Documentation (Future You Will Thank You)

README must include:

project purpose

setup steps

env variables

how to run

Document complex flows (diagrams help)

11. Security Basics (Mandatory)

Validate all user input

Never trust frontend

Hash passwords

Rate limit APIs

Role-based access control

12. Performance & Scalability Mindset

Avoid unnecessary DB calls

Paginate lists

Cache where logical

Think: “What happens with 10× users?”

13. Code Reviews Culture

No direct merge to main

Review for:

logic

security

readability

Critique code, not people

14. Refactor Regularly

Technical debt is unavoidable

Schedule cleanup

If something feels messy — it probably is

15. One Golden Rule

Write code as if someone else will maintain it at 3 AM — and that someone is you.
